# Underflow in the context of computing refers to a situation where a number is smaller than the smallest value that can be represented by a particular data type. For unsigned integers, underflow happens when a negative value is assigned or calculated, which cannot exist in unsigned types. If you attempt to assign or calculate a negative value using an unsigned integer type, it will "wrap around" to the largest value that the data type can hold.
